A Catalog is a collection (a database) of Graphs.  
When creating a Catalog, if no filename is specified, a memory-resident Catalog is created instead.
To add particles to a Catalog, use the GraphStream operator .AddTo():
adding v=1,000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
adding v=3,000001,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,
adding v=3,000002,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,
adding v=3,000003,p=1,v=3,"3oOO 3    ","","1-2-3-1",3,9,27,
adding v=3,000004,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1-2=3-1",1,13,19,

When we call Select() from a catalog without any selection criteria, we'll get the whole catalog back:
All,000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
All,000002,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1-2=3-1",1,13,19,
All,000003,p=1,v=3,"3oOO 3    ","","1-2-3-1",3,9,27,
All,000004,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,
All,000005,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,

If we try to add particles that are already present in a catalog, they are dropped.
Notice that particles of v=1 and 3 do not make it past .AddTo(), allowing you see only particles that have been added.
adding v=1,2,3,000001,p=1,v=2,"2ooO 2    ","","1-2",4,10,
adding v=1,2,3,000002,p=1,v=2,"2oOO 2    ","","1=2",2,10,
adding v=1,2,3,000003,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,

Let's just select particles with 3 vertices and at least 2 loops:
v=3 && loops > 2,000001,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1-2=3-1",1,13,19,
v=3 && loops > 2,000002,p=1,v=3,"3oOO 3    ","","1-2-3-1",3,9,27,
v=3 && loops > 2,000003,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,
v=3 && loops > 2,000004,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,

So far, our catalog is full of equivalent particles with different labeling.
AddTo() will properly drop all dupes:
no dupes,000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
no dupes,000002,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,
no dupes,000003,p=1,v=2,"2oOO 2    ","","1=2",2,10,
no dupes,000004,p=1,v=2,"2ooO 2    ","","1-2",4,10,
no dupes,000005,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1-2=3-1",1,13,19,
no dupes,000006,p=1,v=3,"3oOO 3    ","","1-2-3-1",3,9,27,
no dupes,000007,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,
no dupes,000008,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,

It's common to filter duplicate Graphs, so a convenience function DropDupes() does the same as the above:
still no dupes,000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
still no dupes,000002,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,
still no dupes,000003,p=1,v=2,"2oOO 2    ","","1=2",2,10,
still no dupes,000004,p=1,v=2,"2ooO 2    ","","1-2",4,10,
still no dupes,000005,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1-2=3-1",1,13,19,
still no dupes,000006,p=1,v=3,"3oOO 3    ","","1-2-3-1",3,9,27,
still no dupes,000007,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,
still no dupes,000008,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,

Let's put everything we've learned together and create a complete catalog of all possible 2x3 particles.
First, we generate a catalog of all possible particles containing while keeping all edges (and self-edges) to be positive.
We call this the "pure matter" catalog since particles with only loops and positive edge correspond to matter in positive time and space.
Pure matter includes electrons, muons, protons, neutrons, and neutrinos.
Pure,000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
Pure,000002,p=1,v=2,"2ooO 2    ","","1-2",4,10,
Pure,000003,p=1,v=2,"2oOO 2    ","","1=2",2,10,
Pure,000004,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,
Pure,000005,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,
Pure,000006,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,
Pure,000007,p=1,v=3,"3oOO 3    ","","1-2-3-1",3,9,27,
Pure,000008,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1-2=3-1",1,13,19,
...so there's exactly *8* particles in the pure matter catalog for v=1..3, nice!

How about a catalog that includes anti-matter particles?  For that, we use AllVtxSigns().
We call this the "mixed matter" catalog since contains it particles constructions with negative loops (negative self-edges).
Mixed,000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
Mixed,000002,p=1,v=1," ooo    _ ","","1^",1,

Finally, let's include *all* possible particles using PermuteEdgeSigns().
We call this the "complete" catalog since every possible particle (having any combination of negative edges).

With a complete catalog, we can query for a given particle's Traces and get a list of all possible equivalent "phase modes":
muon phases (long way),000001,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,
muon phases (long way),000002,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA    _         _ ","","1~2=3",3,15,27,
muon phases (long way),000003,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA  __    __      ","","1-2~~3",3,15,27,
muon phases (long way),000004,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA  ___   __    _ ","","1~2~~3",3,15,27,

The function PhaseModes() wraps the above into a convenient function.
